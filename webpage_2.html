<p> I'm a 14 year old girl that is going to attend Sobrato High School in Morgon hill, California.
  I am confident, nice, kind, and patient when working with peers. I work well with my friends and
  classmates in projects and classwork.
  I've been inspired by many animation movies, such as, Coraline, Spiderman back to Spiderverse,
  and other movies made by Pizxar.
